test_scraper_logic.py

Standalone logic-level test suite for fb_group_url_collector.py.

This does NOT drive a real browser or write to the real Google Sheet -- it
imports the pure functions (classification, phone extraction, date parsing,
URL validation, dedup, quota) and runs them against synthetic post text and
mock DOM-like objects, so it can run without Selenium/Chrome/Sheets access.
