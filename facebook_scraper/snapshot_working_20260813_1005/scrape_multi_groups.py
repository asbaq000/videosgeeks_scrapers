scrape_multi_groups.py

Daily multi-group runner: runs the same extraction/qualification pipeline as
fb_group_url_collector.py across the Facebook Group URLs the user curated in
their "FB Groups" sheet, writing qualifying video-editing leads (buyer +
video-editing context + remote/freelance, per is_qualifying_video_editing_lead)
to the "Lead Scraper" sheet as it goes -- one group at a time, not batched at
the end -- and stopping the moment the shared MAX_LEADS_PER_RUN quota (see
fb_group_url_collector.py) is reached for the day.

Meant to be run on a schedule (e.g. Windows Task Scheduler, daily at 9 AM).
The scheduled task can only launch this script; it cannot log into Facebook
for you -- see run_daily.bat, which starts the debug Chrome window pointed
at a persistent profile so a session logged in once keeps working across
days, same as any normal browser profile.

Deviates from the main tool's usual scope in one respect: it navigates
itself between groups (driver.get(url)) instead of only reading a page the
user already opened. This is done on the user's explicit instruction and
explicit group list -- it never joins a group, never logs in, and skips any
group that doesn't render post content without joining (e.g. "request to
join" gates), rather than trying to bypass that.

Each group's scan uses fb_group_url_collector's own MAX_POSTS_PER_RUN /
CONSECUTIVE_OLD_POSTS_TO_STOP settings (not a separate, smaller per-group
cap here) -- so it covers a group's FULL available post history within the
DAYS_BACK window, not just the first handful of posts.
