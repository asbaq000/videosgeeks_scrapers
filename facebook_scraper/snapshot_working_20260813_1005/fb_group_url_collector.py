"""
fb_group_url_collector.py

Collects Facebook POST URLs (only) from a Facebook Group page that the user
has already opened and manually logged into, in their own Chrome browser.

SAFETY / SCOPE (read before modifying):
  - This script never logs into Facebook. It never sees, asks for, or stores
    a Facebook email/password, and it never creates or persists Facebook
    cookies of any kind.
  - It attaches Selenium to a Chrome instance the USER already started and
    authenticated by hand (via Chrome's --remote-debugging-port). If no such
    session exists, the script simply fails to connect -- it never tries to
    open a login form or fill one in.
  - It does not attempt to defeat CAPTCHAs, 2FA, or any other Facebook
    security/anti-bot mechanism, and it does not try to hide the fact that
    it is automation.
  - It only reads posts already rendered in the DOM of the page the user has
    open, plus modest auto-scrolling to let the group's normal lazy-loading
    fire. It never navigates itself into a group the user hasn't opened.
  - Facebook does not expose real post permalinks as static hrefs (confirmed
    via live testing): the visible timestamp link resolves only to the bare
    group URL. To read the permalink, this performs an ordinary left click
    on that already-visible element -- the same click a real user would
    make -- then returns to the group feed via browser back navigation.
    This is normal, visible interaction with content already on the page,
    not a bypass of any login/CAPTCHA/anti-bot mechanism, and it is capped
    by MAX_POSTS_PER_RUN per run.
  - It collects post permalink URLs (and, optionally, the post's displayed
    timestamp). It never extracts names, profile URLs, emails, comments, or
    any other personal information.
  - It also does light best-effort parsing of each post's OWN text (topic,
    niche/hashtags, budget, and -- if the poster explicitly included one in
    their OWN post text, for people to contact them -- a phone number). This
    only ever reads the post's own visible text, never a profile, comment,
    or other field. Phone numbers embedded in Topic/Niche/Budget text are
    still redacted from those specific fields to keep them readable; the
    number itself is captured once, in the "Has Contact Info" column.

Run this only against your own Facebook account and groups you already
belong to, in line with Facebook's Terms of Service and applicable law.
